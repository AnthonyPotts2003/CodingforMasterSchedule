# How to Enable GitHub Pages in Your Existing Repository

## üéØ GitHub Pages is Built Into GitHub!

GitHub Pages is **not** a separate service - it's a feature that's already included with your GitHub account. You just need to enable it for your repository.

## üìç Step-by-Step Guide to Enable GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Go to Your Repository Settings
1. Open your GitHub repository in a web browser
2. Click on the **"Settings"** tab (it's in the top navigation bar, next to "Code", "Issues", etc.)

### Step 2: Find the Pages Section
1. In the left sidebar, scroll down and look for **"Pages"**
2. It should be near the bottom of the sidebar, under "Security" and "Integrations"
3. Click on **"Pages"**

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Under **"Source"**, you'll see a dropdown menu
2. Click the dropdown and select **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Under **"Branch"**, select **"main"** (or "master" if that's your default branch)
4. Under **"Folder"**, select **"/ (root)"**
5. Click the **"Save"** button

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
1. After saving, GitHub will show you a message like:
   ```
   Your site is published at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
   ```
2. It may take a few minutes for the first deployment to complete
3. You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

## üîç If You Can't Find the Pages Section

### Check Repository Visibility
GitHub Pages only works with **public repositories** on free accounts:
1. Go to your repository's **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **"Danger Zone"**
3. If it says "Change repository visibility", make sure it's set to **"Public"**
4. If it's private, you'll need to make it public (or upgrade to GitHub Pro for private Pages)

### Check Repository Type
Make sure you're looking at a regular repository, not:
- A fork (unless you've enabled Pages for the fork)
- An organization repository (may have different settings)

## üß™ Test Your GitHub Pages

Once enabled, test that your JSON file is accessible:

1. **Direct URL Test**: Go to `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/schedule_data_combined.json`
2. **Should see**: Your JSON data displayed in the browser
3. **If you see**: "404 Not Found" - wait a few more minutes for deployment

## üîß Update Your Dashboard.html

Once GitHub Pages is working, update your Dashboard.html:

```javascript
// Replace this line in your loadData() function:
const response = await fetch('https://corsproxy.io/?https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/osj8mpndudzz705pwjsxx/schedule_data_combined.json?rlkey=zx9s7kiyd2yhwqcsrjb3ozmv7&st=sysxua2t&raw=1');

// With this (replace with your actual username and repo name):
const response = await fetch('https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/schedule_data_combined.json');
```
